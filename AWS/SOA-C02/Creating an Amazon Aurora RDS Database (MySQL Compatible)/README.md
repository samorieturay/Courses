## Learning Objectives Completed

1. **Validate the Security Groups, Route Tables, and NACLs**
2. **Create a Database Subnet Group**
3. **Create an Amazon Aurora Cluster**
4. **Verify That You Can Authenticate to the Aurora Cluster**

## Environment Setup

- **Region:** `us-east-1`
- **Aurora Creation Method:** Manual (‚ùå _Easy Create was NOT used_)
- **Instance Class:** `db.t3.medium`
- **Aurora Cluster Identifier:** `AuroraLabCluster`
- **Subnet Group Name:** `AuroraLabSubnetGroup`

- **Configuration:**
  - Writer and reader nodes in different Availability Zones
  - Subnet group: `AuroraLabSubnetGroup`
  - Security group: MySQL security group provided by the lab

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'aurora_server_id';
```
