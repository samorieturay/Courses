1.
Protocol: https  
Domain: catalog.drexel.edu  
Route: /undergraduate/collegeofcomputingandinformatics/computerscience/  
Port: (implicit) 443 (default port for HTTPS)

2.
Request Method: GET – This means the client is requesting data from the server (typically to retrieve a webpage).  
Route Requested: /foo/bar – This is the path of the resource being requested.  
File Served: Probably an HTML file or dynamic route handler corresponding to /foo/bar.  
User-Agent Header: Identifies the client software making the request (e.g., browser and operating system).  
Accept-Language Header: Indicates the client prefers content in English (US and general English).  
Request Body: No – GET requests do not have a body by HTTP specification.

3.
Status Code: 200 OK – The request was successful and the server is returning the requested resource.  
Content-Type: text/plain – The returned content is plain text (not HTML, JSON, etc.).

4.
A single page can include many resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, analytics scripts). Each resource requires its own HTTP request, which is why many requests are sent.

5.
Responses:
- In the browser: The server returns plain text saying "Hello!" (or similar) and may initiate additional requests for favicon or styles.
- In the terminal (curl): You see headers and the plain response "Hello!" only.

Differences in Requests:
- curl sends minimal headers.
- Browsers send more headers (User-Agent, Accept, Accept-Language), request additional assets (like favicon), and maintain session info (cookies, etc.).

6.
The same response is returned because the server is not routing based on path. It’s configured to respond identically to all GET requests regardless of the route.

7.
Response now includes a `Content-Type` of `text/html`.  
In the browser: The text may be interpreted as HTML (e.g., new lines are not rendered, tags are parsed if present).  
In curl: The raw HTML is displayed the same way as plain text.  
The change occurs because browsers render content differently depending on the specified MIME type.
